# Contracts

`contracts` is the public contract boundary for `chill.institute`.

## Stack

- protobuf source schemas in `proto/`
- generated Go, TypeScript, and OpenAPI artifacts
- `mise` for generation and verification

## Commands

- `mise install`
- `mise run generate`
- `mise run verify`

## Conventions

- Treat changes here as consumer-facing API changes.
- Keep protobuf sources, generated artifacts, and package metadata in sync.
- Commit schema and generated output together.
- This repo does not own backend, web, mobile, or CLI application logic.
